AirBnB is a complete web application, integrating database storage,
a back-end API, and front-end interfacing in a clone of AirBnB.

Every time the backend is initialized, AirBnB instantiates an instance of
FileStorage called storage. The storage object is loaded/re-loaded from
any class instances stored in the JSON file file.json. As class instances are
created, updated, or deleted, the storage object is used to register
corresponding changes in the file.json

It creates, shows and destroys classes.
